## Introduction

This code is the implement of our XXX 2020 paper (under review). Our model is based on [mt-dnn](https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn). The main difference is the sampling and training strategy used in this paper, which is the file `./mt_dnn/acl_controller.py`.

## Preparation
The glue experiments are defined in `experiments/glue`, while the transfer learning experiments are defined in `experiments/transfer`
